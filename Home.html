			<p>Chairman Message.</br>vision is based on hard work, open communication, a strong emphasis on team work and a high level of responsibility. This visionary culture allows and emphasises our wards not only to adopt the present day challenges but also individual responsibilities to the society and our nation at large. Learning should be based on doing things and not merely knowing things. Until and unless learning solutions relate to real life and motivate the learner to acquire and apply the knowledge, the whole process will remain superficial. Any engineering institution worth its name looks to optimize the productivity of global leaders. Our institution has set specific objectives and planned activities for achieving excellence in all spheres of technical education. The service of the institution in creating personally mature, professionally equipped and service-oriented graduates is really worth mentioning. We strongly believe in academic excellence and do not compromise on teaching standards or discipline. These three things are the springboards on which we operate. We also believe in total learning and sharing. Have a visit to RYMEC and feel good to get good education</p>
